## Why HeroUI Native?

**Beautiful by default** — Professional look out of the box, no extra styling needed.

**Accessible** — Accessibility is managed following mobile development best practices, with proper focus management, touch accessibility, and screen reader support built into every component.

**Flexible** — Each component is made of customizable parts. Change what you need, leave the rest.

**Developer-friendly** — Fully typed APIs, predictable patterns, and excellent autocompletion.

**Maintained** — We handle updates, bug fixes, and new features. Just update the package.

**Lightweight** — Tree-shaken. Only what you use goes into your app.

**Future-proof** — Compatible with the latest [Expo](https://expo.dev/) and on [Tailwind v4](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4) via [Uniwind](https://uniwind.dev/), designed for AI-assisted development.

## A Living Library, Not Copy-Paste

Copy-paste code works until it breaks. You're left maintaining outdated dependencies that stop evolving.

HeroUI Native is different. It's a living library that grows with you:
- Automatic updates and fixes
- New features without extra work
- Components stay current with React Native, Tailwind, and mobile platforms
- Deep customization, not shallow theme tweaks
- AI-friendly APIs for code generation

HeroUI Native is not a snapshot—it's a garden that keeps growing. 🌱
