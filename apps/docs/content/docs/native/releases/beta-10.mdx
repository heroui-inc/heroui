## What's New

### New Components

#### Bottom Sheet

This release introduces the **Bottom Sheet** component, a versatile overlay component that slides up from the bottom of the screen with animated transitions and swipe-to-dismiss gestures.

  srcDark="https://heroui-assets.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/docs/native/components/videos/bottom-sheet-docs-dark.mp4"
/>

**Features:**
- Smooth animated transitions with gesture support
- Multiple snap points for flexible sizing
- Detached mode for custom positioning
- Customizable overlay with blur effects
- Full accessibility support
- Built on [@gorhom/bottom-sheet](https://gorhom.dev/react-native-bottom-sheet)

**Usage:**
```tsx
import { BottomSheet, Button } from 'heroui-native';

<BottomSheet>
  <BottomSheet.Trigger asChild>
    <Button>Open Bottom Sheet</Button>
  </BottomSheet.Trigger>
  <BottomSheet.Portal>
    <BottomSheet.Overlay />
    <BottomSheet.Content>
      <BottomSheet.Close />
      <BottomSheet.Title>Title</BottomSheet.Title>
      <BottomSheet.Description>Description</BottomSheet.Description>

## Component Improvements

### PressableFeedback Refactor

The [PressableFeedback](/docs/native/components/pressable-feedback) component has been refactored with an improved API and better animation control.

**Improvements:**
- Enhanced animation configuration API
- Better support for custom animation states
- Improved performance and smoother animations
- More flexible feedback positioning options

The component maintains backward compatibility while providing more control over press feedback animations.

## API Enhancements

### Animation API State Prop Extension

The Animation API has been extended with a new `state` prop that allows you to disable animations while customizing properties. This provides more granular control over animation behavior.

**New Capability:**
```tsx
<Component
  animation={{
    state: 'disabled', // or 'disable-all' or boolean
    // ... other animation properties
  }}
/>
```

The `state` prop can be:
- `'disabled'`: Disable animations while still allowing property customization
- `'disable-all'`: Disable all animations including children
- `boolean`: Simple enable/disable control

This enhancement makes it easier to customize animation properties without enabling animations, useful for fine-tuning component behavior.

### use-theme-color Multiple Colors Selection

The `use-theme-color` hook has been refactored to handle multiple colors selection, making it more flexible and powerful for theme customization.

**Enhancement:**
- Support for selecting multiple colors at once
- Improved color selection logic
- Better performance when working with multiple color values

This improvement makes it easier to work with complex theming scenarios where multiple colors need to be selected and applied together.

## Documentation

### Animated Styles Guide Comments

Added comprehensive comments and documentation to the Animated Styles Guide, making it easier for developers to understand and use animation features effectively.

**Improvements:**
- Enhanced code examples with detailed comments
- Better explanation of animation patterns
- Clearer guidance on when to use different animation approaches
