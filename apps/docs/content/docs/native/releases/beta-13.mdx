- Better visual consistency during tab transitions
- Reduced layout recalculations during animations

**Related PR:** [#227](https://github.com/heroui-inc/heroui-native/pull/227)

### Popover Arrow Sizing and Visual Connection

The [Popover](/docs/native/components/popover) component has been improved with better arrow sizing and visual connection to the popover content, creating a more cohesive visual appearance.

**Improvements:**

- Improved arrow sizing relative to popover content
- Enhanced visual connection between arrow and popover
- Better alignment and spacing
- More polished overall appearance

**Related PR:** [#243](https://github.com/heroui-inc/heroui-native/pull/243)

### Form Components Decomposition

Form components have been decomposed into standalone primitives, providing developers with more flexibility and better control over component composition.

**Improvements:**

- Decomposed form components into standalone primitives
- Improved component reusability and composition
- Better separation of concerns
- Enhanced flexibility for custom form layouts

**Related PR:** [#247](https://github.com/heroui-inc/heroui-native/pull/247)

### Input Android Shadow Fix

## API Enhancements

### Granular Exports for Bundle Optimization

The library now provides granular exports for each component, allowing developers to reduce bundle size by importing only the components they need.

**New Capability:**

```tsx
// Granular imports - use when you need only a few components
import { HeroUINativeProvider } from "heroui-native/provider";
import { Button } from "heroui-native/button";
import { Card } from "heroui-native/card";

// General import - imports the whole library, use when you're using many components
import { Button, Card } from "heroui-native";
```

Granular imports are ideal when you only need a few components, as they help keep your bundle size smaller. General imports from `heroui-native` will include the entire library, which is convenient when you're using many components throughout your app.

**Available granular exports:**

- `heroui-native/provider` - Provider component
- `heroui-native/[component-name]` - Individual components
- `heroui-native/portal` - Portal utilities
- `heroui-native/utils` - Utility functions
- `heroui-native/hooks` - Custom hooks

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important**: To keep the bundle size under control, you must follow the pattern with granular imports consistently. Even one general import from `heroui-native` will break this optimization strategy.
</Callout>

**Related PR:** [#233](https://github.com/heroui-inc/heroui-native/pull/233)

### Style Class Names Export

All components now export their style class names, enabling developers to reference component styles programmatically and create custom styling solutions.

**New Capability:**

```tsx
import { buttonClassNames } from "heroui-native";

// Access component class names programmatically
const customStyles = {
  base: buttonClassNames.base,
  variant: buttonClassNames.variant,
};
```

This enhancement provides developers with programmatic access to component class names, enabling advanced styling scenarios and custom theme implementations.

**Related PR:** [#252](https://github.com/heroui-inc/heroui-native/pull/252)

## Style Fixes

### Style Optimizations

- **Quaternary Variant Removal**: Removed quaternary variant and polished component styles for better consistency
- **Component Style Polish**: Enhanced styling across multiple components for improved visual consistency
- **Shadow and Border Radius Updates**: Improved shadow and border radius consistency across components
- **Theme Variable Cleanup**: Simplified theme variables and removed redundant color-mix calculations

**Related PR:** [#246](https://github.com/heroui-inc/heroui-native/pull/246)
