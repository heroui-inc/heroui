## Component Improvements

### Popover Close via Ref Fix

The [Popover](/docs/native/components/popover) component has been fixed to properly handle programmatic close operations via ref.

**Improvements:**

- Fixed ref-based close method to properly trigger close animations
- Improved state synchronization between ref calls and component state
- Enhanced reliability of programmatic close operations

This fix ensures that when developers call `popoverRef.current?.close()`, the popover closes reliably with proper animation and state management.

**Related PR:** [#207](https://github.com/heroui-inc/heroui-native/pull/207)

### Popup Controlled State Fix

Popup components (including Dialog, Bottom Sheet, and Popover) have been fixed to properly handle controlled state via the `isOpen` prop.

**Improvements:**

- Fixed controlled state synchronization for popup components
- Improved handling of external state changes
- Enhanced reliability when using controlled mode

This fix ensures that popup components correctly respond to external state changes when using controlled mode, providing developers with more predictable behavior when managing popup state externally.

**Related PR:** [#215](https://github.com/heroui-inc/heroui-native/pull/215)

### Button, Chip, and Tabs Border Radius Fix

The [Button](/docs/native/components/button), [Chip](/docs/native/components/chip), and [Tabs](/docs/native/components/tabs) components have been fixed to properly respect global border radius configuration.

**Improvements:**

- Fixed border radius configuration application for Button component
- Fixed border radius configuration application for Chip component
- Fixed border radius configuration application for Tabs component
- Improved consistency across components using global theme configuration

These fixes ensure that global border radius settings defined in the theme configuration are properly applied to Button, Chip, and Tabs components, providing consistent styling across the application.

**Related PR:** [#218](https://github.com/heroui-inc/heroui-native/pull/218)

### TextField.Input Props Cleanup

The [TextField](/docs/native/components/text-field) component's Input subcomponent has been cleaned up by removing the `animation` and `isAnimatedStyleActive` props.

**Changes:**

- Removed `animation` prop from TextField.Input
- Removed `isAnimatedStyleActive` prop from TextField.Input
- Simplified component API for better maintainability

These props were removed to streamline the TextField.Input API and reduce complexity. Animation behavior is now handled internally by the component, providing a more consistent and predictable experience without requiring manual animation configuration.

## API Enhancements

### HeroUINativeProvider devInfo Configuration

The `HeroUINativeProvider` component now supports `devInfo` configuration options for enhanced development experience.

**New Capability:**

```tsx
import { HeroUINativeProvider } from "heroui-native";

export function App() {
  return (
    <HeroUINativeProvider
      devInfo={{
        // Configuration options for development
      }}
    >
      {/* Your app content */}
    </HeroUINativeProvider>
  );
}
```

This enhancement provides developers with additional configuration options for development and debugging scenarios, making it easier to troubleshoot and optimize applications during development.

### Variant Style Prop Support

The [Checkbox](/docs/native/components/checkbox), [Radio](/docs/native/components/radio), [TextField](/docs/native/components/text-field), and [InputOTP](/docs/native/components/input-otp) components now support the `variant` style prop for easier variant customization.

**New Capability:**

```tsx
import { Checkbox, Radio, TextField, InputOTP } from "heroui-native";

// Apply variant styles directly via style prop
<Checkbox variant="bordered" style={{ variant: "flat" }}>
  Option 1
</Checkbox>

<Radio variant="solid" style={{ variant: "bordered" }}>
  Option 2
</Radio>

<TextField variant="underlined" style={{ variant: "bordered" }}>
  <TextField.Input />
</TextField>
```

This enhancement provides developers with more flexibility when customizing component variants, allowing variant changes to be applied via the style prop in addition to the component's variant prop.

**Related PR:** [#220](https://github.com/heroui-inc/heroui-native/pull/220)

## Style Fixes

### Border Radius Configuration

Fixed global border radius configuration not applying correctly to certain components.

**Fixes:**

- Fixed Button component not respecting global border radius configuration
- Fixed Chip component border radius application
- Fixed Tabs component border radius application

### Style Optimizations

- **Border Radius Consistency**: Improved consistency of border radius application across Button, Chip, and Tabs components
- **Theme Configuration**: Enhanced theme configuration propagation to ensure all components respect global settings

## Bug Fixes

This release includes fixes for the following issues:

- **[Issue #93](https://github.com/heroui-inc/heroui-native/issues/93)**: Fixed global border radius configuration not applying to Button component in hero-ui-native using Unwind. The Button component now properly respects border radius settings defined in the global theme configuration, ensuring consistent styling across the application.

- **[Issue #213](https://github.com/heroui-inc/heroui-native/issues/213)**: Fixed Select controlled mode (`isOpen`) not working. The Select component now properly handles controlled state when the `isOpen` prop is provided, allowing developers to manage Select open/close state externally with predictable behavior.
