<Callout type="warning">
  HeroUI v3 is currently in **beta**. Expect breaking changes before the stable release. Test thoroughly in a development environment before migrating production applications.

## For AI Assistants

Below are three approaches for AI assistants to access migration documentation. ***We recommend using the HeroUI Migration MCP server*** and leveraging its prompts and tools, but all options provide agents with the complete documentation.

| Feature | MCP Server | Agent Skills | AGENTS.md |
|---------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Data source** | Remote endpoints | Remote endpoints | Local files |
| **Access method** | MCP tools | Script files | Local file reads |
| **Setup** | MCP config | Install command | `heroui-cli` command |
| **Updates** | Real-time | Real-time | Manual |
| **Offline** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Tools** | MCP tools + prompts | Scripts | ❌ |

## Major Changes

<section id="major-changes">

- **Dependencies**: Update React to v19+, HeroUI packages to v3, Tailwind CSS to v4, remove Framer Motion
- **No Provider Required**: v3 removes the need for `HeroUIProvider`
- **Component API Updates**: Many components use React Aria Components patterns
- **Compound Components**: New compound component patterns for better customization. See individual component guides for details.
- **Hooks Removed**: v2 component hooks like `useSwitch` or `useInput` are removed - use compound components instead. `useDisclosure` is replaced with `useOverlayState`. See the [Hooks Migration Guide](/docs/react/migration/hooks) for details.
- **Configuration**: Remove `heroui()` plugin from Tailwind config, update CSS imports, remove `hero.ts` file
- **Item identity**: Collection items (Dropdown, Listbox, Select, Accordion, etc.) now use `id` and `textValue` in v3; keep React's `key` for lists.

</section>

### Item identity and accessibility (key, id, textValue)

In v2, collection components (Dropdown, Listbox, Select, Accordion, etc.) used **React's `key`** as the item identity. The same value drove both React's list reconciliation and the component's selection/expand state. In v3, which uses React Aria Components, those roles are split:

- **`id`** — v3 uses an explicit **`id`** prop on each item for selection state, focus, and callbacks (e.g. `selectedKeys`, `expandedKeys`, `onSelectionChange`). Use the same (or equivalent) value you used for `key` in v2 so that state and callbacks continue to refer to the correct item.
- **`textValue`** — v3 requires **`textValue`** on items when the visible content is not plain text (e.g. when using `Label`, icons, or `Description`). It is used for screen reader announcements and type-ahead.
- **`key`** — **Keep using React's `key`** on list items. It is still required for React's reconciliation and is independent of `id`.

When migrating: add `id` (and `textValue` where needed) for v3's API, but keep `key` for React.

## Migration Strategies

HeroUI v2 and v3 cannot coexist in the same project without special setup. You have two migration approaches to choose from:

### Full Migration

**Best for:** Projects that can dedicate focused time to complete migration in one go.

**How it works:**
- Migrate all component code first (project will be broken during this phase)
- Switch dependencies to v3
- Complete styling migration

**Advantages:**
- Simpler setup - no complex coexistence configuration
- Cleaner transition - only one version active at a time
- Supported by Migration MCP prompts

**Disadvantages:**
- Project is broken during migration
- All components should be migrated before switching dependencies

**Get started:** [Full Migration Guide](/docs/react/migration/full-migration)

### Incremental Migration

**Best for:** Projects that need to stay functional during migration, teams migrating gradually over time, large codebases migrating feature-by-feature.

**How it works:**
- Set up coexistence using pnpm aliases or component packages
- Migrate components one-by-one while keeping project functional
- Complete migration and remove v2 dependencies

**Advantages:**
- Project remains functional during migration
- Can migrate gradually over time
- Can test v3 components alongside v2

**Disadvantages:**
- More complex initial setup
- Potential styling conflicts
- Requires managing two versions simultaneously
