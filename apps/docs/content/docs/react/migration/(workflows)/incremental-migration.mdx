description: Step-by-step guide for migrating HeroUI v2 to v3 incrementally while keeping both versions working side-by-side

<Callout type="warning">
  HeroUI v3 is currently in **beta**. Expect breaking changes before the stable release. Test thoroughly in a development environment before migrating production applications.
</Callout>

## Overview

Incremental migration with coexistence allows you to migrate from HeroUI v2 to v3 component-by-component while keeping your project functional throughout the migration process. This approach uses special setup strategies to allow both v2 and v3 components to work side-by-side.

### Migration MCP

The HeroUI Migration MCP server provides tools for AI agents and prompts to help with migration. See the [Migration MCP Tool](/docs/react/migration#migration-mcp-tool) section in the main migration guide for setup and available prompts.

### Limitations and Considerations

Before choosing this approach, be aware of:

- **Bundle Size**: Both versions will be included during migration, increasing bundle size
- **Styling Conflicts**: v2 and v3 styles may conflict; test thoroughly
- **Type Conflicts**: TypeScript may show conflicts if both versions are imported in the same file
- **Provider**: v2 requires `HeroUIProvider`, v3 doesn't - you may need conditional provider wrapping
- **React Version**: v3 requires React 19+, v2 supports React 18+ - ensure React 19 is installed
- **Setup Complexity**: Requires more complex initial setup compared to full migration

## Strategy Selection

Choose your strategy based on how you currently import v2 components:

- **Using `@heroui/react`**: Use Strategy A (pnpm aliases)
- **Using component packages** (`@heroui/button`, `@heroui/card`, etc.): Use Strategy B (component packages)

## Strategy A: Using pnpm Aliases

This strategy uses pnpm package aliases to install v3 packages under different names, allowing both versions to coexist.

### Setup

1. Install v3 packages with aliases:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@heroui/react": "2.8.6",
    "@heroui/theme": "2.4.24",
    "@heroui-v3/react": "npm:@heroui/react@beta",
    "@heroui-v3/styles": "npm:@heroui/styles@beta"
  }
}
```

2. Import v2 components from `@heroui/react`:

```tsx
import {Button} from "@heroui/react"; // v2
```

3. Import v3 components from `@heroui-v3/react`:

```tsx
import {Button} from "@heroui-v3/react"; // v3
```

### Migration Process

1. **Migrate one component at a time:**
   - Update imports to use `@heroui-v3/react`
   - Update component code to v3 API
   - Test the migrated component
   - Verify styling looks correct

2. **Continue until all components are migrated**
   - Track which components have been migrated
   - Test each migrated component thoroughly

3. **Once all components are migrated, switch to v3-only:**
   - Remove v2 dependencies (`@heroui/react`, `@heroui/theme`)
   - Remove aliases
   - Update all imports to `@heroui/react` (remove `-v3` suffix)
   - Complete styling migration

### Considerations

- Both CSS systems will be loaded (v2 via Tailwind plugin, v3 via CSS import)
- You'll need both Tailwind configs temporarily
- Bundle size will be larger during migration
- Some styling conflicts may occur

## Strategy B: Using Component Packages

This strategy uses v2's component-specific packages alongside v3's unified package.

### Setup

1. Install v3 main package and v2 component packages:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@heroui/react": "beta", // v3
    "@heroui/styles": "beta", // v3
    "@heroui/button": "2.8.6", // v2
    "@heroui/card": "2.8.6", // v2
    // ... other v2 component packages as needed
  }
}
```

2. Import v3 components from `@heroui/react`:

```tsx
import {Button} from "@heroui/react"; // v3
```

3. Import v2 components from component packages:

```tsx
import {Card} from "@heroui/card"; // v2
```

### Migration Process

1. **Install v3 packages** (`@heroui/react@beta`, `@heroui/styles@beta`)
2. **Install v2 component packages** for components not yet migrated
3. **Migrate one component at a time:**
   - Remove the v2 component package from dependencies
   - Update imports to use `@heroui/react` (v3)
   - Update component code to v3 API
   - Test the migrated component
4. **Continue until all components are migrated**
5. **Remove remaining v2 component packages**
6. **Complete styling migration**

### Considerations

- Only works if your project uses component-specific packages
- Requires managing multiple package dependencies
- v3 doesn't have component packages, so this is a one-way migration path

## CSS Configuration for Coexistence

During coexistence, you'll need both CSS systems:

```css
/* globals.css */
@import "tailwindcss";

/* v2 styles via Tailwind plugin */
/* (configured in tailwind.config.js) */

/* v3 styles */
@import "@heroui/styles";
```

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important:** Import order matters. Import `tailwindcss` first, then `@heroui/styles`.
</Callout>

## Tailwind Configuration

You'll need both Tailwind configs temporarily:

**v2 Config (tailwind.config.js):**

```js
const {heroui} = require("@heroui/react");

module.exports = {
  plugins: [heroui()],
  // ... other config
};
```

**v3 Config:** No plugin needed, but ensure Tailwind v4 is installed.

## Component Migration

For each component you migrate:

1. **Review the component migration guide**
   - Use the [Component Migration Reference](/docs/react/migration#component-migration-reference) table
   - Check component-specific migration guides

2. **Update imports**
   - Strategy A: Change `@heroui/react` → `@heroui-v3/react`
   - Strategy B: Change component package → `@heroui/react`

3. **Update component code**
   - Follow component migration guide
   - Update props, component structure, and API calls
   - Replace hooks with compound components if needed
   - Change `onClick` to `onPress` for interactive components

4. **Test the migrated component**
   - Verify component renders correctly
   - Test functionality and interactions
   - Check for styling conflicts
   - Ensure v2 components still styled correctly

5. **Document migration**
   - Track which components have been migrated
   - Note any issues or concerns

## CSS Conflict Handling

During coexistence, both v2 and v3 CSS systems will be loaded. Monitor for conflicts:

1. **Watch for styling inconsistencies**
   - Check if v2 and v3 styles are conflicting
   - Verify both CSS imports are present and in correct order

2. **Guide conflict resolution**
   - Ensure CSS import order: `tailwindcss` first, then `@heroui/styles`
   - Check Tailwind config has v2 plugin configured
   - Verify v3 CSS is imported correctly

3. **Test styling after each migration**
   - Verify migrated components look correct
   - Check for unexpected style overrides
   - Ensure v2 components still styled correctly

## Completing the Migration

Once all components are migrated:

1. **Remove v2 dependencies:**
   - Remove `@heroui/react` and `@heroui/theme` (Strategy A)
   - Remove all `@heroui/*` component packages (Strategy B)
   - Remove aliases (Strategy A)

2. **Update all imports:**
   - Change `@heroui-v3/react` → `@heroui/react` (Strategy A)
   - Change component package imports → `@heroui/react` (Strategy B)

3. **Update CSS:**
   - Remove v2 Tailwind plugin from config
   - Keep only `@import "@heroui/styles";`

4. **Complete styling migration:**
   - Follow the [Styling Migration Guide](/docs/react/migration/styling)
   - Update utility classes, color tokens, etc.

## Migration Checklist for Coexistence

Use this checklist to track your incremental migration progress:

### Initial Setup
- Choose strategy (A: aliases or B: component packages)
- Install v3 packages (with aliases or directly)
- Configure CSS for both versions
- Ensure React 19+ is installed
- Set up both Tailwind configs temporarily

### Component Migration (Repeat for each component)
- Review component migration guide
- Update imports (Strategy A or B)
- Update component code to v3 API
- Test the migrated component
- Check for styling conflicts
- Document migration progress

### Completion
- Migrate all components
- Remove v2 dependencies
- Remove aliases (Strategy A)
- Update all imports to v3-only
- Remove v2 Tailwind plugin
- Update CSS to v3-only
- Complete styling migration
- Test entire application

## Next Steps

After completing the incremental migration:

1. Review the [v3 component documentation](/docs/react/components)
2. Explore new components available in v3
3. Check out the [styling guide](/docs/react/getting-started/handbook/styling)
4. Learn about [composition patterns](/docs/react/getting-started/handbook/composition)
