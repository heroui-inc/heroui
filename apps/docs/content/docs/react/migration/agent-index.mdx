For AI assistants: use this as the entry point when helping migrate HeroUI v2 → v3.

## Entry

Choose a migration strategy:

- **Full migration** (project will be broken during migration) → read `(workflows)/agent-guide-full.mdx`.
- **Incremental** (v2 and v3 coexist) → read `(workflows)/agent-guide-incremental.mdx`.

## Reference in this bundle

- **Cross-cutting guides:** `hooks.mdx`, `styling.mdx`.
- The workflow guides above already inline the "major changes", "key API changes", component reference table, and "new components" sections.
- **Per-component guides:** `(components)/<component>.mdx` (e.g. `(components)/button.mdx`, `(components)/select.mdx`). Use the component reference table in the workflow guides to find the right file.
