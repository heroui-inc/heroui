HeroUI is a React component library built on [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html). Every component comes with smooth animations, polished details, and built-in accessibility—ready to use, fully customizable.

## Why HeroUI?

**Beautiful by default** — Professional look out of the box, no extra styling needed.

**Accessible** — Built on [React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/components.html) with focus management, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support.

**Flexible** — Each component is made of customizable parts. Change what you need, leave the rest.

**Developer-friendly** — Fully typed APIs, predictable patterns, and excellent autocompletion.

**Maintained** — We handle updates, bug fixes, and new features. Just update the package.

**Lightweight** — Tree-shaken. Only what you use goes into your app.

**Future-proof** — Built for [React 19](https://react.dev/blog/2024/12/05/react-19) and [Tailwind v4](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4), designed for AI-assisted development.

## A Living Library, Not Copy-Paste

Copy-paste code works until it breaks. You're left maintaining outdated dependencies that stop evolving.

HeroUI is different. It's a living library that grows with you:
- Automatic updates and fixes
- New features without extra work
- Components stay current with React, Tailwind, and browsers
- Deep customization, not shallow theme tweaks
- AI-friendly APIs for code generation

HeroUI v3 is not a snapshot—it's a garden that keeps growing. 🌱
