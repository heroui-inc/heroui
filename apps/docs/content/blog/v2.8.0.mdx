## TailwindCSS v4

HeroUI is now compatible with TailwindCSS v4. HeroUI CLI supports to initialize starter templates with Tailwind v4 as well.

To upgrade your existing projects, please refer to [migration guide](/docs/guide/tailwind-v4#migration-steps).

## Overlay Enhancement

The overlay and outside interaction handling for overlays, popovers, modals, dropdowns, selects, and tooltips have been improved to result in more consistent dismissal behaviour. 

## Component Enhancement

### Toast

- The return type of `addToast` has been changed from `void` to `string` where the string value is the unique key value of the newly created toast.
- A new method `closeToast(key: string): void` has been introduced to accept a key value of `string` type and close the toast with the key.
- The Toast closing order was updated from LIFO to FIFO.

<CodeDemo title="Close Toast" files={closeToast} showEditor={false}/>

### Input

The Input component now features a new label placement option `outside-top`. Previously, labels would always remain inside the input field if there was no placeholder. 

The new `outside-top` option ensures that labels are consistently displayed at the top of the input field, regardless of whether a placeholder is present, similar to the existing `outside-left` placement.

<CodeDemo title="Label Placement" files={inputLabelPlacement} />

### Select

Two new properties `isClearable` and `onClear` have been introduced in the Select component. A clear button is visible when a value is slected and a callback function triggered upon clearing the selection for custom handling.

<CodeDemo title="Clearable" files={selectIsClearable} />

`endContent` has been introduced in the Select component.

<CodeDemo title="End Content" files={selectEndContent} />

### Table

The table header previously utilized either a chevron-up or chevron-down icon for sorting, which was not configurable. A new `sortIcon` property has been introduced, allowing users to customize the default sort icon. This icon will only be applied when `allowsSorting` is set to true.

<CodeDemo
  asIframe
  title="Sort Icon"
  resizeEnabled={false}
  displayMode="visible"
  files={tableSortIcon}
  previewHeight="520px"
  iframeSrc="/examples/table/sort-icon"
/>

## Package Size Optimization

Optimizations have been made to the sizes of specific individual packages to enhance performance. Please note that these changes are limited to certain packages such as `@heroui/input`, `@heroui/modal`, etc., and do not extend to the global package `@heroui/react`.

## What's Next?

We're excited to share that HeroUI v3 (Alpha) is just around the corner! You are expected to create stunning interfaces with 50% smaller bundle size, lightning-fast native CSS animations, and effortless customization that adapts to your design vision. 

As an Alpha version, we're actively gathering feedback and refining the current components, including Button, Accordion, Avatar, TextArea, Checkbox, and more. Your input is invaluable in shaping the future of the library.

## Breaking Changes

- The component style have been updated to align TailwindCSS v4.
- `loadingIcon` now renames to `loadingComponent` in Toast component
